        <h2>Guiding values and how they were embodied in the UI</h2>
        <p>
          My UI was guided by values of calmness, simplicity, and relaxation. I
          wanted users to feel peaceful, like they were at the beach. The design
          uses soft blue colours, gentle bubble movement, and ocean sounds to
          create this mood. I avoided text so that the interface feels more
          natural. The bubbles, sound, and motion work together to communicate
          without needing any words.
        </p>

        <h2>Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          The feedback in my UI comes from both sound and movement. Each bubble
          plays a different musical note using Tone.js, which makes the
          experience more interesting and fun. The different tones make the
          interaction feel more dynamic and playful, while still matching the
          calm theme.

        <h2>Information Design</h2>
        <p>
          The information design in my project is very minimal. I wanted to
          remove distractions and only keep elements that add to the calm
          experience. Instead of using text or icons, I use movement, sound, and
          colour to give users information. For example, the way the bubbles
          float upward and disappear suggests that they can be interacted with.
          The design lets users explore and discover naturally without needing
          words or labels.

      <section>
        <h2>Mapping</h2>
        <p>
          The mapping of interactions in my UI is simple and direct. When users
          click a bubble something happens, it plays a different musical note
          each time. The connection between action and response is clear, so
          users understand the interaction right away. The position and movement
          of the bubbles also guide the eye and invite exploration, which helps
          the user learn what to do just by observing the interface.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Learnability</h2>
        <p>
          The UI is easy to learn because it teaches through experience instead
          of text. The popup at the beginning gives a short introduction, but
          after that, users can understand how it works just by interacting. The
          consistent reactions like sound and motion help users quickly pick up
          what happens when they engage with the bubbles. After one or two
          clicks, most users can enjoy the interaction without needing more
          guidance.

        <h2>Significant changes since the work in progress milestone</h2>
        <p>
          Since my earlier version, I made several big changes. I added more
          bubbles, changed the background to a realistic beach image, and made
          the bubbles bigger, more bolder and easier to see. I also added
          Tone.js so that each bubble plays a different note when clicked. I
          really liked the addition of Tone,js, I felt like this update made the
          UI more interactive and immersive. The new popup message also helps
          first-time users understand the experience better.

        <h2>Production timeline and development time</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Step 1: Concept & Visual Planning</strong><br />
          Started by sketching the layout and look of the Chill Bubble UI. The
          plan focused on a clean, open screen with floating bubbles in the
          centre and a calm ocean-inspired background. The main goal was to
          create a relaxing and wordless experience, guided by colour, movement,
          and sound rather than text.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Step 2: Base Structure</strong><br />
          Built the initial structure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Created
          one main bubble in the middle of the screen that responded to clicks
          with a looping ocean breeze track to set the calm, ambient mood.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Step 3: Visual & Interaction Refinement</strong><br />
          Expanded from a single bubble to multiple floating bubbles. Improved
          the visual design by making bubbles larger, slower, and more visible.
          Adjusted the animation and background to fit the beach theme better.
          Added subtle glow effects and smoother transitions to make the
          experience more immersive.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Step 4: Sound Design & Tone.js Integration</strong><br />
          Introduced Tone.js to make each bubble play a unique musical note when
          clicked. Balanced the Tone.js synth sounds with the background ocean
          ambience. This made the interaction more dynamic and engaging while
          still keeping the relaxing tone.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Step 5: User Experience & Feedback</strong><br />
          Added a popup message that appears when users first load the page,
          explaining the interaction briefly. This helped with learnability
          without breaking the no-text aesthetic. Conducted user testing with
          friends and family to check if the triggers worked and are functioning
          correctly.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Step 6: Final Polish</strong><br />
          Adjusted colours, transparency, and bubble movement speed to enhance
          visibility and harmony. Final testing focused on ensuring that the
          sound, visuals, and interaction all worked together to create a
          peaceful, unified experience.

        <h2>Aspect that I’m most proud of</h2>
        <p>
          I’m most proud of how calm and connected everything feels in the final
          version. The sounds, colours, and animations all work together to
          create a relaxing experience. The combination of ocean sounds and
          musical notes gives it a peaceful and playful feeling. It captures the
          atmosphere of the beach that inspired me from the beginning.

        <h2>Most challenging aspect</h2>
        <p>
          The most challenging part of this project was finding the right
          balance between visuals, sound, and interaction. I wanted everything
          to feel calm and natural, but still interesting enough to keep users
          engaged. Making the bubbles move smoothly while also reacting to
          clicks and playing sounds took a lot of testing. It was challenging to
          make everything work together in harmony, but in the end, it helped
          the whole experience feel more alive and peaceful.
