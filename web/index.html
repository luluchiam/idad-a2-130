          I chose the “No text characters” prompt for my Bubble UI. The idea was
          to create an interface that communicates and responds entirely without
          written words, using floating bubbles as the central element. The
          bubbles become both the focus and the interaction point: its movement,
          colour, and sound provide all the feedback a user needs. My visual
          plan was to have glowing bubbles against a beach or ocean theme
          background.

          The inspiration for this project comes from my love for the beach.
          I’ve always loved going there, I love the feeling of the sand under my
          feet, the salty breeze, and the sunset. Being at the beach is
          incredibly calming and satisfying for me. I especially love the sounds
          of the gentle crashing of waves, the soft rustle of the sand as it
          shifts, the distant call of seagulls and more. These sounds instantly
          make me feel relaxed, and I wanted to capture that sense of peace in
          my project.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project isn’t about serving a specific purpose, it's something I
          created for myself, inspired by what I enjoy. I also added bubbles
          because I thought they would be a fun, cute element. I’ve always been
          obsessed with those aesthetic, floating bubbles that you would see on
          Pinterest, and I wanted to bring a little bit of that whimsical
          feeling into my work. By combining the ambient beach sounds with
          playful visual elements like bubbles, I hoped to create a small,
          immersive space that evokes the soothing, joyful atmosphere of the
          beach.

        <h2>Technical Conceptualisation</h2>
        <div class="image-row">

        </div>
        <p>
          For the technical side, I built the UI using HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript, and connected it to the audio system so that the bubble
          responds with sound. A looping ocean breeze track plays in the
          background to set a calm mood. When the user clicks the bubble, the
          sound changes slightly. I used <code>Math.random()</code> in the code
          so that these changes are never exactly the same, sometimes the volume
          shifts a little, sometimes the effect feels stronger or softer. This
          randomness makes the experience feel more natural, like real waves or
          wind. The process can be thought of like this:
        </p>
        <p class="flow-diagram">
          User interaction → Event listener (hover/click) → JavaScript function
          with Math.random() → Web Audio API modulation → Ambient feedback to
          user.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>For my peer user testing, I asked two prompts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Is the interaction (clicking the bubble to play sound) clear and
            easy to understand?
          </li>
          <li>
            How effective is the visual style of the bubble? If not, what other
            things can I improve on?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The feedback was very helpful. It confirmed that my design has a
          strong starting point but needs more depth to keep users more engaged.
          I agree with the comments about adding more bubbles, making the
          background fit the theme better, and providing a richer interactive
          experience. I also see the importance of clearer instructions or
          subtle guidance for first-time users. For the final project, based on
          the feedback that was given in Wednesday's user testing, I will add a
          beach themed background and more visual elements to the project to add
          more depth and also add a clear guide/instructions for the users.
